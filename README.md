# RDR2-Mission-Creator

Red Dead Redemption 2

To create a new mission, you have to edit the variables inside the Mission_creator.h file and the "Set_coords, Npc_patrol and Set_task" functions in Mission_creator.cpp.

After that, compile the file (an .asi file) and put it and the Mission Creator.ini in the main directory of the RDR2.

The mission menu is opened with the Page Down key.
